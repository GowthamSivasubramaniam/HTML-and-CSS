# Pure CSS Carousel/Slider

## Objective

Develop an image carousel that cycles through slides automatically and/or manually.
## Requirements

- Use CSS animations (`@keyframes`) to create an auto-sliding effect.
- Implement manual slide selection using the `:checked` pseudo-class with hidden radio buttons or the `:target` pseudo-class.
- Ensure that the slider is responsive and visually engaging.

## Demo - Desktop view and Mobile view
