# Complex Responsive Layout with Grid and Flexbox

## Objective
Design a sophisticated webpage layout that combines CSS Grid and Flexbox techniques.
## Requirements

- Use CSS Grid to structure the main layout and Flexbox to handle the alignment and spacing of inner elements.
- Create overlapping elements (using `position` and `z-index`) and dynamic reordering based on viewport size.
- Implement a sticky header or sidebar that remains visible as the user scrolls.

## Demo - Desktop view and mobile view
