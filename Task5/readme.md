# Modal Popup Using the :target or Checkbox Hack

## Objective

Build a modal (popup window) that opens and closes without JavaScript.

## Requirements

- Use an anchor link with an ID and the `:target` pseudo-class—or a hidden checkbox with the `:checked` pseudo-class—to control the modal’s visibility.
- Style the modal to appear centered with an overlay backdrop.
- Add CSS transitions for the modal’s appearance and disappearance.

## Demo - Desktop view
